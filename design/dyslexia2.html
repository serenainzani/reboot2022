        <h2>The next chapter for Lloyds Banking Group</h2>
        <p>
          Today, we embark on the next chapter for the Group as we set our new strategy, which will shape how the business operates over the next three to five years.
  
          We’ve also published our financial results, showing the strong foundations and distinct competitive advantages we intend to build on.
          
          Since joining Lloyds Banking Group as Group Chief Executive in August, I have seen first-hand the dedication and values which run through this organisation.
          
          I’ve seen and heard many examples about how we’ve supported customers and communities during last year – being there when it matters and demonstrating how financial services can be a force for good. I would like to express my gratitude to all of our colleagues for their resilience, commitment and hard work throughout 2021.
  
          
          <br><br> <strong>Helping Britain Prosper</strong> 
          <br>
          <p>When I joined the Group last August, I wrote about how much I’d admired the Group for its really clear purpose.
  
          Helping Britain Prosper guides our business model and the strategic choices we make. In developing our new strategy, we have built broader stakeholder outcomes into each part of how we create value so that we are a truly purpose-led organisation.
          
          This is a fantastic business, and we have a clear purpose that resonates well with our people, stakeholders and the communities we serve. I believe there are huge opportunities for the Group to do more and make the most of our competitive strengths.</p>
          <br><strong>Growing the business</strong> 
          <p>Growth is a core focus of our strategy with nearly two-thirds of our £3 billion strategic investment aligned to growing and diversifying revenue.
  
              We have carefully prioritised opportunities across each of our businesses to ensure we generate value in the near-term as well as creating new revenue streams which deliver over the longer-term:</p>
        <ul>
          <li style="color: white">In the Consumer segment of our Retail and Insurance & Wealth businesses, we will bring more of our products and services to our existing customers, as well as innovating and broadening our product offerings and making it easier for customers to access them through our intermediary partners.</li>
          <li>In addition, we will create a new mass affluent offering to grow in this attractive and under-served market segment across banking, protection and investments.</li>
          <li style="color: white;"> We will digitise and diversify our SME business, including growing revenues in areas where we have lower market shares today.</li>
          <li> And we will target disciplined growth of our corporate and institutional business.</li>
      </ul>
